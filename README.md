# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenge. 
Each day's problem is solved using a variety of programming languages to explore and learn different tools and ecosystems.

## Running Solutions

### Swift
Navigate to the `swift` directory and use Swift Package Manager (SPM):
```bash
cd swift
swift run
```

To run tests:
```bash
swift test
```

### Python
Navigate to the day's directory and run the solution:
```bash
cd python/Day01
python3 main.py
```

Run tests (if applicable):
```bash
python3 -m unittest test.py
```

## Progress

| Day | Python | Swift |
|-----|--------|-------|
| 01  |  ❌    | ✅ ✅   |
| 02  | ❌     | ❌    |

## Notes
- Each solution directory includes an `input.txt` file containing the puzzle input.
- Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
